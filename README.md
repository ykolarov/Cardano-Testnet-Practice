# Cardano Testnet Practice
This app uses the [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/) API to collect data about stake pools on the [Caradano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain.

Currently, the application is capable of fetching all Cardano Testnet pools with metadata, displaying the following:
- their name
- active pledge
- active stake
- blocks minted
